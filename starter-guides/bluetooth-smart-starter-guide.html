	<h1>Bluetooth Low Energy Starter Guide - Getting Started with Mobile Apps for BLE</h1>

	<img class="evo-content-side-image-small" src="images/bluetooth-smart-logo.png" />

	<p>Bluetooth Low Energy is a fundamental communication technology for the Internet of Things. This technology is also called Bluetooth LE, Bluetooth Smart or simply abbreviated as BLE. Bluetooth Low Energy is used for applications like proximity beacons, communicating with embedded microcontrollers, and radio controlled models.</p>

	<p>Modern mobile phones have support for BLE, and this makes it possible to develop all sorts of mobile apps that communicate with BLE devices. Evothings Studio comes with the EasyBLE JavaScript library that enables mobile apps to scan for and connect to BLE devices on iOS and Android.</p>

	<h1>Introduction article</h1>

	<p>Read the article <a href="https://evothings.com/ble-app-development-explained/" target="_blank">BLE app development in JavaScript explained â€“ Bluetooth Low Energy in action</a> to get an introduction to BLE and mobile app development.</p>

	<h2>Example apps</h2>

	<p>Many of the <a href="../examples/examples.html">Evothings example apps</a> that ship with Evothings Studio use BLE to communicate to microcontrollers and other hardware. Browse the dokumentation and have a look at the list of examples in Evothings Workbench.</p>
	<p>Click the COPY button in Evothings Workbench to make a copy of the example app(s) you wish to run. Note that some examples need some configuration before they are usable. Edit the code and modify to your needs. The documentation pages contain the instructions you need to get started.</p>

	<h2>Tutorials</h2>

	<p>Read the guide <a href="../tutorials/how-to-connect-to-ble-devices.html">How to connect to BLE devices</a> to learn about the essentials of BLE programming using Evothings JavaScript libraries.</p>
	
	<p>Check out the <a href="../tutorials/tutorials.html">tutorials page</a>, which lists many articles and blog posts that are relevant to Bluetooth Low Energy enabled mobile apps.</p>

	<h2>API documentation</h2>

	<p>Visit the <a href="../api/api-overview.html">API overview page</a> for links to documentation of the EasyBLE library.</p>

	<h2>Get started quickly with scanning for BLE devices from your phone</h2>

	<p>The quickest and easiest way to get started with a BLE app is to <a href="https://evothings.com/download/" target="_blank">download Evothings Studio</a> and run the "BLE Scan" example app. You will find in under the "Examples" tab in Evothings Workbench. The app is included with the download. You will be up and running in just 5 minutes!</p>
